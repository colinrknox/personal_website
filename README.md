# Personal Website

This is the repository that houses the front end of my website.

# Website Components

This repository is the React/Tailwind front end. I also have a Go server handling backend requests for files from the front end as well as API requests.
And the final component, is a Unix CRON job that runs periodically to pull new markdown posts from another repository as well as image files and process
them and stage them for the Go server.
